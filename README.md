#### Lesson 1: *Intro To CREATEmory* ðŸ‘‹ <br/> Duration: *1 Hour* <br/> Topics: *CREATEmory, Github, Command-Line, HTML/CSS* <br/>

--
## Lesson Objectives
***After this lesson students will be able to:***

   * Explain the purpose and vision of CREATEmory
   * Use the basic tools necessary to build software (IDEs, Terminal, etc...)
   * Understand the basics of Github and Git
   * Understand the basics of the Command-Line
   * Create a simple webpage using HTML & CSS

----
## What is CREATEmory
CREATEmory is, above all, a **community of software engineers** who find it fun to work on **practical, creative applications**. It is a place to meet like-minded students and collaborate with them on **real-life projects**.

Next in order, CREATEmory is an organization that:
    
*  **Teaches software engineering skills** to Emory students through comprehensive, student-run courses (like this one!).
*  **Provides real project experience**, both from with Emory and outside, for students to apply their newfound skills.
*  **Manages the execution of projects** by organizing teams and training students on best Project Management practices.

#### During this course, you will learn how to properly work in a team of developers. Once ready, you will be able to work within real teams, on real projects.

## Software Built For Building Software

#### Terminal:

We will go over the Terminal and the Command-Line later on in this lesson, but for now, **if you are using Windows, please download <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1" target="_blank">Windows Powershell</a>** so it is easier to follow along with the instructor.

#### IDE:
Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the code editor that you will use to write your code. For this course, **we suggest downloading <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> to use as your IDE**. However, if for whatever reason you don't lie VSC, <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime</a> are also solid options.

> For those of you who have already taken CS courses and are used to coding in Java, you might be tempted to use a Java-specific IDE like IntelliJ, but, because we will not be using Java, it would be better to use another option.


### Ultimately, which tools you use to build software are up to you. Pick whichever feels best.

## Terminal

Your Terminal is your Command-Line interface. Learning how to use it will drastically improve your efficiency while navigating through files, running programs, and executing many other tasks. **For now, we will just go over the basics so that you're ready to use Git and Github.**

> If you are using Windows, you will have to follow along with Windows Powershell. Most of the commands will be the same, but there are a few differences.

ðŸ”´ **Open Terminal**

- `âŒ˜ (Command) + Space`, or use Spotlight
- "*Terminal"
- `Enter`

> You can customize the appearance of your Terminal by going to `Terminal > Preferences > Profiles`

#### Bash
Initially, your Terminal is set up to run the Bash scripting language. All you have to do is type in a command and press enter to run it.

ðŸ”´ **Try Out Some Common Bash Commands**

- `pwd` - will print the absolute path to the current working directory.
- `ls` - Lists the contents of the current directory. But it will only list the non-hidden files unless you add **Flags...**

#### Flags

Flags can be added to many Bash commands to modify them. They are denoted by a dash `-`. For example, if you wanted to list the contents of the current directory, you would add the `-a` flag to `ls` and type: `ls -a`

> A useful Flag that can be used on most commands is the `--help` flag,  which will print out additional information. Not that the help command requires two dashes `--`.

#### Navigating With the Command-Line

One command you will use very often is `cd`. `cd` stands for "Change Directory" and using it will do exactly that.

ðŸ”´ **Navigate Through Some Folders**

- `cd some_directory` *(Note that if you type `cd` and then click Tab, you can view your options and autofill)*
- `cd ..`
	- `..` refers to the parent folder, so using it will navigate you back to where you started. If you want to refer to the current folder, use `.`
- `cd`
	- If you use just use `cd` without specifying where to go, it will just take you to the home directory

ðŸ”´ **Try Some Other Very Common Commands**

- `mkdir directory_name` will create a new directory in the current folder
- `touch file_name` will create a new file in the current folder

### This is a very basic overview of the Command-Line. We recommend you spend some time practicing on your own. *For further Command-Line information and practice, <a href="https://github.com/CREATEmory/CLASS-1-Intro-To-CREATEmory/blob/main/TERMINAL.md" target="_blank">please follow these instructions</a>. You will learn more commands and have access to extra assignments.*
