#### Lesson 1: *Intro To CREATEmory* ðŸ‘‹ <br/> Duration: *1 Hour* <br/> Topics: *CREATEmory, Github, Command Line, HTML/CSS* <br/>

--
## Lesson Objectives
***After this lesson students will be able to:***

   * Explain the purpose and vision of CREATEmory
   * Use the basic tools necessary to build software (IDEs, Terminal, etc...)
   * Understand the basics of Github and Git
   * Understand the basics of the Command Line
   * Create a simple webpage using HTML & CSS

----
## What is CREATEmory
CREATEmory is, above all, a **community of software engineers** who find it fun to work on **practical, creative applications**. It is a place to meet like-minded students and collaborate with them on **real-life projects**.

Next in order, CREATEmory is an organization that:
    
*  **Teaches software engineering skills** to Emory students through comprehensive, student-run courses (like this one!).
*  **Provides real project experience**, both from with Emory and outside, for students to apply their newfound skills.
*  **Manages the execution of projects** by organizing teams and training students on best Project Management practices.

#### During this course, you will learn how to properly work in a team of developers. Once ready, you will be able to work within real teams, on real projects.

## Software Built For Building Software

####There are two main tools we will use for this course: your Terminal, and your IDE of choice. 

#### Terminal:

We will go over the Terminal and the Command Line later on in this lesson, but for now, **if you are using Windows, please download [Windows Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1)** so it is easier to follow along with the instructor.

#### IDE:
Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the code editor that you will use to write your code. For the purposes of this course, **we suggest downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to use as your IDE**. However, if for whatever reason you don't lie VSC, [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) are also solid options.

>For those of you who have already taken CS courses and are used to coding in Java, you might be tempted to use a Java-specific IDE like IntelliJ, but, because we will not be using Java, it would be better to use another option.


#### Ultimately, which tools you use to build software are up to you. Pick whichever feels best.
